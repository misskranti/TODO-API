# Todo API

A simple REST API to support and managing todo list. Through this API, developers can code their applications in the tech stack of their choice and use this API to support the backend of the application. In this API, I have used JSON Web Tokens for authentication purposes. I have done unit testing as well for all the routes. Database and API are hosted on MongoLab & Heroku respectively.

### Technologies used: 

* NodeJS
* ExpressJS
* MongoDB
* Mongoose
* JSON Web Tokens
